# Bounding-perfect-powers-in-EDS
SageMath code for the paper *Explicitly bounding perfect powers in elliptic divisibility sequences* by Sander R. Dahmen and Joey M. van Langen.
It relies on the *Modular Method SageMath Package* at https://github.com/jmvlangen/modular-method-package by the second-named author.
The code at the current repository is a minor adaptation from code from the *examples/EDS* folder in the *Modular Method SageMath Package*.
